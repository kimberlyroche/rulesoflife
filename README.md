Fitted model output has been omitted from this repository for file size considerations but is available upon request. The `fido::basset` model can be fit to the filtered 16S data using the script `analysis_fit_model.R`.

## Recapitulating figures

Code for figure generation and supporting analysis is in files labeled `main_*.R` and `supplement_*.R`.
