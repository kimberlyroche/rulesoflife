\title{Permute the data within samples, maintaining relative abundances but
scrambling patterns of variation within taxa}
\usage{

  host_sample_min = 75,
  count_threshold = 1,
  sample_threshold = 0.2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tax_level}{taxonomic level at which to agglomerate data}

\item{host_sample_min}{minimum sample number for host inclusion in the
filtered data set}

\item{count_threshold}{minimum count for taxon inclusion in the filtered data
set}

\item{sample_threshold}{minimum proportion of samples within each host at
which a taxon must be observed at or above count_threshold}
}

a named list of count table, taxonomy, and metadata components
